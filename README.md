# Persona Module
You can think of the persona as the companion's ‘face’. This is a mathematically expressed amorphous shape. This shape consists of multiple properties (ie: size, speed, brightness, complexity, color, etc) that change based on user inputs and interaction. Every user will have a unique persona and their persona will evolve over time. 

# Persona Reactions
Each persona will react to the user inputs through animations that include visual changes, sound, color, and haptic feedback. The types of reactions described below:
* State Reaction: A reaction is a particular audiovisual response from the persona. 
* Dynamic Idle: An anthropomorphised animation based on average of computed sentiment.
